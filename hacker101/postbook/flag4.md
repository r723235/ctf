### hints
* You can edit your own posts, what about someone else's?


### solution

1. navigate to the *Home* page
2. select *edit* on any post
3. change the `id` param to a value that leads to a post by **admin**
   * e.g. `id=1` or `id=2`
4. you can change the text if you want. don't have to
5. after hitting **post**, you'll see the flag
