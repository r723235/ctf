# Level 2: Persistence is key

### hints
* Note that the "welcome" post contains HTML, which indicates that the template doesn't escape the contents of status messages.
* Entering a `<script>` tag on this level will not work. Try an element with a JavaScript attribute instead.
* This level is sponsored by the letters *i*, *m* and *g* and the attribute **onerror**.

### solution

* enter the following post
   * `<img src="x" onerror="alert(123)">`
